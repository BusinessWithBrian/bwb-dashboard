<h1>Options Trading Level 2 — The 3 Things That Actually Move Options Prices</h1>
<h2>BWB — Business With Brian | Script Draft v1</h2>
<p><em>Target: 1,700–2,300 words | Format: Narrative Thesis</em></p>
<hr>
<p>You bought a call option. The stock went up two bucks. And your option… lost money.</p>
<p>If that's ever happened to you, you're not alone. And no, your broker isn't broken. There are three invisible forces pulling on every single options contract you own — and if you don't understand them, you're basically flying blind. It's like playing Mike Tyson's Punch-Out without knowing the patterns. You're gonna get knocked out and you won't even know why.</p>
<p>In my last video on options trading, I gave you the 101 — what calls and puts are, strike prices, premiums, expiration dates, the whole foundation. That video happens to be the most popular video on my channel with over 600,000 views. And the number one comment I got was: "Brian, I understand the basics now, but I'm still losing money. What am I missing?"</p>
<p>What you're missing are these three forces. And that's exactly what I plan to cover today. I'm going to break down the three things that actually move your options prices — beyond just the stock going up or down. Then I'll show you how smart investors use these forces to their advantage. And I'll finish with a practical income strategy that puts all three to work.</p>
<p>But before we get into it, if you got value from my last options video, please consider pressing that like button so my channel can grow. And if you're brand new here, I cover investing, personal finance, and the strategies that helped me retire at 46 after working at companies like Target and Amazon. Alright, let's get into it.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>FORCE NUMBER ONE: DELTA — YOUR OPTIONS SPEEDOMETER</strong></p>
<p>So here's the first thing most beginners don't realize. When you buy a call option, a $1 move in the stock does NOT mean a $1 move in your option. Not even close.</p>
<p>The amount your option moves for every dollar the stock moves happens to be called Delta. And it's measured on a scale from zero to one. If your option has a delta of 0.50, that means for every $1 the stock goes up, your option goes up about 50 cents. If your delta is 0.20, you're only getting 20 cents of movement per dollar.</p>
<p>Think of delta like a speedometer. An option deep in the money might have a delta of 0.90 — it's moving almost dollar-for-dollar with the stock. But an option way out of the money? That delta could be 0.05. The stock moves a dollar and your option barely flinches.</p>
<p>Here's why this matters right now. Let's say you buy a call option on Apple with a strike price of $250 when Apple's trading at $220. That option is $30 out of the money. The delta on that thing might be 0.10. So if Apple goes up $5 in a week — which would be a solid move — your option only gains about 50 cents per share. On a contract of 100 shares, that's $50. But you probably paid $150 or $200 for that contract. You're still underwater.</p>
<p>And that's the trap. A lot of beginners buy cheap, way-out-of-the-money options because they're cheap. But cheap options have low deltas. The stock has to make a massive move just for you to break even. It's like buying a lottery ticket — sure, the payout could be huge, but the odds aren't in your favor.</p>
<p>The practical takeaway? When I'm looking at options, I pay attention to delta first. Options with deltas between 0.40 and 0.70 happen to be the sweet spot for most strategies — enough movement to be worth it, without paying the full premium of a deep in-the-money option. That's the balance.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>FORCE NUMBER TWO: THETA — THE SILENT KILLER</strong></p>
<p>Now here's the one that catches everybody off guard. Every single day that you hold an options contract, it loses a little bit of value. Even if the stock doesn't move at all. This happens to be called Theta — also known as time decay.</p>
<p>And it makes perfect sense when you think about it. Remember in my last video, I compared an options contract to putting a deposit down on Taylor Swift concert tickets? Well, that deposit gives you a time window. And as that window shrinks, the value of having that reservation goes down. If the concert is 30 days out, that reservation has a lot of value. If the concert is tomorrow and tickets haven't moved, that reservation is basically worthless.</p>
<p>Options work the exact same way. And here's the kicker — theta doesn't decay evenly. It accelerates. In the first two weeks of a 45-day contract, you might lose a few dollars. But in the last 10 days? That decay ramps up hard. It's like a snowball rolling downhill. By the final week, your option could be losing 5 to 10% of its remaining value every single day.</p>
<p>Let me put some real numbers on this. Say you buy a 30-day call option on Nvidia for $500. If the stock just sits flat — doesn't go up, doesn't go down — here's roughly what happens to your $500:</p>
<p>After 10 days, it's worth maybe $420. After 20 days, about $300. After 25 days, it's down to $175. And by expiration? If the stock hasn't moved past your break-even, that contract goes to zero. Your entire $500 is gone.</p>
<p>This is why roughly 77% of options expire worthless according to CBOE data. Not because people are picking the wrong direction — but because time ate their contract alive before the stock could move enough.</p>
<p>And here's a piece of information that changes everything once you understand it. Theta hurts buyers. But it helps sellers. If you sell an options contract, time decay works in your favor every single day. That's the foundation of income-generating options strategies — and I'll show you one in just a minute.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>FORCE NUMBER THREE: IMPLIED VOLATILITY — THE MARKET'S FEAR GAUGE</strong></p>
<p>Alright, this is the one that confuses people the most. But I'm going to make it simple.</p>
<p>Implied volatility — or IV — is basically the market's best guess at how much a stock is going to move in the future. When IV is high, the market expects big swings. When IV is low, things are expected to stay calm.</p>
<p>And here's the thing — high implied volatility makes options MORE expensive. Low IV makes them cheaper. It's supply and demand. When everyone's nervous — like right before an earnings report, or during a market sell-off — demand for options goes through the roof. And that drives premiums up.</p>
<p>Think of it like insurance in a hurricane zone. Right before a hurricane hits, insurance premiums skyrocket because the risk is high. After the hurricane passes and everything's calm? Premiums come back down. Options pricing works the same way.</p>
<p>This is why you can buy a call option on a stock, the stock goes up, and you still lose money. Because IV was sky-high when you bought the option — maybe right before earnings — and after the announcement, IV collapsed. That collapse in volatility crushed the premium faster than the stock price helped it. Traders call this an "IV crush" and it happens to be one of the biggest reasons beginners lose money around earnings season.</p>
<p>So what do you do about it? Before I buy any options contract, I check the implied volatility. Most brokerage platforms show you IV rank or IV percentile — that tells you where current volatility sits compared to the past year. If the IV percentile is above 70 or 80, options are expensive. That's usually a better time to sell options than to buy them. If IV percentile is below 30, options are cheap and could be a good buying opportunity.</p>

<p><strong>PUTTING ALL THREE FORCES TOGETHER</strong></p>
<p>So now you understand the three forces — delta, theta, and implied volatility. And here's where it gets practical.</p>
<p>When you're buying options, all three forces are often working against you. Low delta means you need a big move. Theta is eating your premium every day. And if IV drops, your option loses value even if the stock moves your way. That's why buying options is harder than most people think.</p>
<p>But what if you flip the script? What if instead of buying options, you sell them?</p>
<p>This is where covered calls come in. And it happens to be one of my favorite introductory strategies for investors — not traders, but investors — who already own stock and want to generate extra income.</p>
<p>Here's how it works. Let's say you own 100 shares of Microsoft at $420 a share. That's $42,000 worth of stock just sitting in your account. You sell a call option with a strike price of $440 — about 5% above the current price — with a 30-day expiration. And the market pays you, say, $5 per share for that contract. That's $500 in premium collected. Right into your pocket.</p>
<p>Now one of two things happens. If Microsoft stays below $440 by expiration — which is the most likely outcome — that option expires worthless and you keep the $500. Your shares are untouched. You can do it again next month. That's roughly a 1.2% return in 30 days on a stock you were planning to hold anyway. Annualized, that's over 14%.</p>
<p>But if Microsoft rockets past $440? You sell your shares at $440 — which is still a profit from your $420 purchase price — plus you keep the $500 premium. Your total gain on the trade is $2,500. That's not a bad outcome either.</p>
<p>The risk? If Microsoft jumps to $480, you miss out on that extra upside above $440. You left money on the table. But you didn't lose money. And in full transparency, I'd rather collect consistent premiums than chase every possible upside. That's a personal choice, and it depends on your risk tolerance.</p>
<p>And here's the beautiful part — all three forces work in your favor with covered calls. Delta? You're short delta on the call, meaning you benefit if the stock stays flat or drifts up slowly. Theta? Time decay is making you money every day because you sold the option. IV? If volatility drops after you sell, the option loses value — which is exactly what you want as the seller.</p>

<p><strong>WHEN OPTIONS MAKE SENSE — AND WHEN THEY DON'T</strong></p>
<p>Now I need to be real with you for a second. Options are powerful tools. But they're not for everyone. And they're definitely not for every situation.</p>
<p>Options make sense when you have a clear view on direction and timing, when you understand position sizing — meaning you're not putting your entire account into one trade — and when you have the discipline to cut losses and take profits at predetermined levels.</p>
<p>Options don't make sense when you're guessing, when you're using money you can't afford to lose, or when you're treating it like a trip to Vegas. I said it in my first options video and I'll say it again — if you have a personality that's prone to gambling, this is not for you. And I'm dead serious about that.</p>
<p>But for investors who want to add another tool to their toolkit — maybe generate some monthly income, or protect a position during uncertain times — options can be incredibly effective when you understand these three forces.</p>
<p>If you want me to go deeper into specific strategies — vertical spreads, the Wheel Strategy, or how to hedge your portfolio with puts — just let me know in the comments. I'm planning to build this into a full series based on what you want to learn.</p>
<p>I have all the terms and concepts from today's video organized in a resource link down in the description for you to reference. I hope this gave you a clearer picture of what's really happening under the hood of options trading. And as always, this is not financial advice — just education from one investor to another.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for watching.</p>
