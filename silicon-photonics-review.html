<div class="script">

<p>Everyone's fighting over which AI chip to buy. NVIDIA, AMD, Broadcom. But here's what most investors are missing. The GPUs aren't the bottleneck anymore. The bottleneck is the cable connecting them.</p>

<div class="broll">[B-roll: data center interior, close-up of copper cable bundles]</div>

<p>Right now, AI data centers use copper wires to move data between thousands of GPUs. And at 1.6 terabits per second — which happens to be the speed required for next-gen AI training — copper generates too much heat, eats too much power, and physically cannot keep up. The fix is silicon photonics. Instead of pushing data through copper with electrical signals, you push it through using light — photons instead of electrons — on a regular silicon chip. That means you can manufacture these in existing semiconductor fabs, making them far more scalable and cheaper than traditional fiber optics. The result is 3.5 times lower power consumption. And when you're running a data center that consumes as much electricity as a small city, that's not incremental. That's transformational.</p>

<div class="broll">[B-roll: fiber optic light pulses, silicon wafer manufacturing]</div>

<p>The market reflects this. Silicon photonics is roughly a $3 billion market today, growing at 25 to 29% annually depending on which research firm you look at. Conservative estimates put it at $10 billion by 2030. The most aggressive say nearly $29 billion by 2034. NVIDIA committed to co-packaged silicon photonics at GTC 2025, and the entire supply chain is following.</p>

<div class="broll">[Show visual: silicon_photonics_visuals/market_growth.html]</div>

<p>So in this video, I'm going to walk you through the entire supply chain — from the foundries that manufacture these chips, to the companies building the optical components, all the way up to the architects designing the systems. Nine companies plus a wild card. And at the very end, I'll give you my personal ranking from strongest to weakest. But before we get into it, if you get any value from my research, please consider pressing the like button so my channel can continue to grow. I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. This is my research and my perspective as an investor.</p>

<div class="broll">[B-roll: transition graphic]</div>
<div class="broll">[Show visual: silicon_photonics_visuals/supply_chain.html]</div>

<p>Everything in silicon photonics starts with manufacturing. Somebody has to take a silicon wafer and etch photonic circuits onto it — lasers, waveguides, modulators — all at the nanometer scale. And in this space, two public companies stand out.</p>

<p>Let's get started with our first company of Tower Semiconductor, ticker TSEM, which happens to be a specialty analog foundry. They don't design chips — they manufacture them for other companies. Think of them as the factory floor for silicon photonics. And their silicon photonics and RF infrastructure segment had a breakout year. Revenue in that segment grew 75% in 2025 compared to 2024. That was their fastest-growing business by a wide margin.</p>

<div class="broll">[B-roll: TSEM stock chart + company logo]</div>

<p>Total revenue for 2025 came in at $1.57 billion, up about 9% year over year. They're guiding Q1 2026 to $412 million, plus or minus 5%. And their updated 2028 model is targeting $2.84 billion in revenue. So they're projecting to nearly double the business in about three years. But here's the big move. Tower committed $920 million in CapEx for 2026 and 2027, specifically aimed at 5x-ing their silicon photonics and SiGe capacity. And over 70% of that new capacity is already reserved or prepaid by customers. That's a huge commitment for a company doing $1.6 billion in revenue. For perspective, that CapEx is more than half their annual revenue going into one bet. But when 70% of the capacity is already spoken for before you even build it, that tells you something about demand. They also expanded their collaboration with Innolight for 100G through 800G optical modules, which tells me the customer base is diversifying beyond NVIDIA. On February 5th, 2026, NVIDIA announced a direct partnership with Tower to build 1.6 Terabit optical modules designed specifically for NVIDIA networking protocols — that's a massive endorsement.</p>

<div class="broll">[Screenshot: TSEM Q4 2025 earnings highlights]</div>

<p>Now here's the risk. That $920 million CapEx is enormous. If AI infrastructure spending slows, or if TSMC enters and commoditizes the manufacturing, Tower could end up overbuilt with expensive, underutilized fabs. Customer concentration is real too — a handful of hyperscalers control the buying. But right now, with the NVIDIA partnership, the 75% SiPho growth, and essentially zero long-term debt, the demand signals are about as strong as you'll find in this space. The stock happens to be trading at a forward P/E around 45, and analysts have a consensus target of roughly $157 with Benchmark at $165. At current prices around $130 to $135, that implies roughly 15 to 25% upside depending on which estimate you use.</p>

<div class="broll">[Screenshot: TipRanks TSEM forecast]</div>

<p>Our next company is GlobalFoundries, ticker GFS, and most people don't think of them as a silicon photonics play. But they should. GlobalFoundries is the third-largest foundry in the world. And on their Q4 2025 earnings call, GFS reported they doubled silicon photonics revenue within communications and data center to over $200 million in 2025, and they expect to nearly double it again in 2026. So we're talking $200 million going to roughly $400 million.</p>

<div class="broll">[B-roll: GFS stock chart + company logo]</div>

<p>Now in the context of GFS's total revenue — about $6.8 billion — silicon photonics is still small. Maybe 3% of the total. You're buying a big company for a small but fast-growing division. And the overall revenue growth has been basically flat, up 0.6% year over year. That's the bear case — the base business isn't exciting. But the valuation is one of the more attractive in this space. Forward P/E around 26. PEG ratio of 0.89. They're sitting on $1.8 billion in cash and generating over $1 billion in free cash flow. The bull case is that GFS gives you silicon photonics exposure on top of a stable, diversified foundry business. You need a little patience with the core. And they expanded to 46,000 wafers per month specifically for silicon photonics production, so they're putting real capacity behind the growth story. Analysts have a consensus target around $51, which at current levels gives you roughly 10 to 15% upside.</p>

<div class="broll">[Screenshot: TipRanks GFS forecast]</div>

<p>Now before we leave the foundry layer, I need to mention the wild card, and that's TSMC. The 800-pound gorilla. TSMC announced their COUPE platform for co-packaged optics mass production in 2026. And this cuts both ways. TSMC entering silicon photonics is a massive validation of the technology. But it's also a competitive threat to Tower and GlobalFoundries. When TSMC enters any market, they tend to drive prices down. Great for adoption. Not great for smaller foundries trying to maintain margins. This is probably the single biggest risk hanging over the foundry layer, and it's something I'd keep an eye on.</p>

<p>So the foundries make the chips. But somebody has to build the actual optical components that go on top of those chips. The lasers, the transceivers, the parts that actually convert electrical signals into light. Without these companies, you've got a silicon chip with no way to move photons.</p>

<p>Let's move on to Coherent, ticker COHR. Coherent — formerly II-VI — happens to be one of the largest optical transceiver makers globally. They make the lasers, the photonic components, and the transceivers that convert electrical signals to optical signals. If Tower makes the foundry, Coherent makes the parts that go on top of it.</p>

<div class="broll">[B-roll: COHR stock chart + company logo]</div>

<p>And the numbers are impressive. Revenue hit a record $1.5 billion in their most recent quarter, up 24% year over year. The full-year revenue run rate is now around $6.3 billion and climbing. And they're seeing acceleration in 800G and 1.6T transceiver demand heading into calendar 2026. They're also expanding into optical circuit switches for AI data centers and diamond silicon carbide composites for cooling. So it's not a one-trick business.</p>

<p>Now the trailing P/E is over 200, which looks scary on the surface. But the forward P/E drops to about 30. And the PEG ratio is 0.34. That tells you the market expects significant earnings growth, and the price relative to that growth is actually reasonable. The bear case is that Coherent carries about $3.5 billion in long-term debt from the II-VI merger, and the business is diversified enough that you're not getting a pure silicon photonics play. But if the 1.6T transition plays out the way the industry expects, Coherent is sitting right in the middle of it. Analysts give Coherent a consensus target around $251, which at current prices implies roughly 15 to 20% upside.</p>

<div class="broll">[Screenshot: TipRanks COHR forecast]</div>
<div class="broll">[Show visual: silicon_photonics_visuals/revenue_comparison.html]</div>

<p>The next company is Lumentum, ticker LITE, and they're a name that keeps coming up in my research on the component side. Lumentum makes the lasers and optical components that go into silicon photonics modules. They're a key supplier of externally modulated lasers for 800G and 1.6T transceivers. Think of them as the supplier that feeds the component layer — the building blocks that make the whole optical stack work.</p>

<div class="broll">[B-roll: LITE stock chart + company logo]</div>

<p>And the growth is fast. Revenue came in at $1.65 billion for fiscal 2025, up 21% year over year. But the trailing twelve-month run rate is about $2.1 billion, which is up over 52% compared to the prior period. That's serious acceleration. But here's where I have to be honest with you. The valuation makes me nervous. Forward P/E of about 95. Price-to-sales over 19. Price-to-book is 47. And the free cash flow is still negative — negative $105 million over the trailing twelve months. So you're paying a big premium for growth that hasn't fully materialized on the bottom line yet. The stock has also already had a massive run, from about $46 at the 52-week low to the $500 to $600 range. The telecom segment, which is the non-AI side, has been weak. And they carry about $2.6 billion in long-term debt. That said, if the 1.6T ramp is bigger than expected, this could still have room to run. Analysts have a target around $566, which at current levels suggests modest upside, but I'd personally watch for a pullback before building a position.</p>

<div class="broll">[Screenshot: TipRanks LITE forecast]</div>

<p>So we've covered the foundries making the chips and the component makers building the optical parts. Now we move up to the architects — the companies designing the actual networking systems, the ones deciding how all these pieces fit together. In a lot of ways, this is where the real power sits in the supply chain.</p>

<p>My next company happens to be Marvell Technology, ticker MRVL, and they made a move in December 2025 that I think is under-appreciated. Marvell is a data infrastructure semiconductor company — networking, storage, custom compute. They announced the acquisition of Celestial AI for over $5 billion. Celestial AI makes something called Photonic Fabric, a technology that claims 25 times greater bandwidth at 10 times lower latency than standard co-packaged optics using vertical 3D photonic packaging directly on the processor.</p>

<div class="broll">[Screenshot: Marvell + Celestial AI acquisition press release]</div>

<p>Now $5 billion is a lot of money for a pre-revenue company. But Marvell's leadership has said that every connection point in the data center has to move from copper to optical. If that's true — and the physics suggests it is — then owning the most advanced photonic interconnect technology could be a huge competitive advantage. The risk is integration. Acquiring a pre-revenue deep-tech startup for $5 billion-plus is a big bet. If Celestial AI's photonic fabric doesn't work at scale, that's a lot of money out the door.</p>

<p>But here's what I like about the valuation. Forward P/E is about 23. PEG ratio is 1.5. Revenue run rate is $7.8 billion, up 45% year over year. And they're generating $1.4 billion in free cash flow. I do need to be transparent — Marvell is technically unprofitable on a GAAP basis because of amortization from prior acquisitions. But on a cash flow basis, the business is healthy. Analysts give Marvell about 50% upside over the next 12 months with a consensus target around $117.</p>

<div class="broll">[Screenshot: TipRanks MRVL forecast]</div>

<p>Let's move on to Broadcom, ticker AVGO, which happens to be the industry leader in co-packaged optics today. They announced their third-generation CPO with 200 Gigabit-per-lane capability and committed to a fourth generation at 400G per lane. They've already shipped over 20 million 100G optical channels and are targeting 5 million 800G units.</p>

<div class="broll">[B-roll: AVGO stock chart + company logo]</div>

<p>Now here's the thing with Broadcom. Revenue is $63.9 billion. They generated $26.9 billion in free cash flow. Gross margins are nearly 68%. This is an absolute machine. Revenue grew 24% year over year — for a company this size, that's remarkable. The forward P/E is about 32. PEG ratio is 0.9. But silicon photonics is a rounding error in Broadcom's total revenue. You're not buying Broadcom for SiPho exposure specifically. You're buying one of the best semiconductor companies in the world, and the co-packaged optics leadership is a bonus. If you want exposure to this theme without losing sleep, this is probably the one. Analysts give Broadcom roughly 20% upside with a target around $457.</p>

<div class="broll">[Screenshot: TipRanks AVGO forecast]</div>

<p>And clearly, a company I have to highlight is NVIDIA, ticker NVDA. Now I'm not including NVIDIA as a silicon photonics pick exactly, and here's why. NVIDIA is the demand creator, not the supply chain play. But their commitment to co-packaged optics is the single biggest validation of this entire thesis. At GTC 2025, Jensen Huang unveiled the Spectrum-X and Quantum-X networking switches, both built with co-packaged silicon photonics. That was NVIDIA telling the entire industry that the future of AI networking runs on light, not copper. And on February 5th, 2026, NVIDIA announced the direct partnership with Tower Semiconductor to build 1.6 Terabit optical modules designed specifically for NVIDIA networking protocols. NVIDIA's SVP of Networking has said the explosive growth of AI is driving the need for a completely new class of high-speed, scalable networking, and that they're working with Tower to make it happen. If you've followed NVIDIA for any amount of time, you know the pattern. When Jensen builds a technology into the NVIDIA stack, the entire supply chain follows. It happened with CUDA. It happened with InfiniBand. And now it's happening with silicon photonics.</p>

<div class="broll">[B-roll: NVIDIA GTC networking demo footage]</div>
<div class="broll">[Screenshot: Tower Semi + NVIDIA press release — towersemi.com]</div>

<p>The numbers today are, well, insane. There's really no other word for it. Revenue of $130 billion, up 114% year over year. $60 billion in free cash flow. Forward P/E of about 24. For a company growing this fast, that's actually not unreasonable. PEG ratio of 0.7. But silicon photonics is a strategic initiative for NVIDIA, not a revenue driver right now. You'd be buying NVIDIA for AI compute dominance, for the networking platform, for the ecosystem lock-in. The SiPho angle is a bonus, not the thesis. Analysts give NVIDIA roughly 40% upside with a target around $254.</p>

<div class="broll">[Screenshot: TipRanks NVDA forecast]</div>

<p>Now we've covered the foundries, the component makers, and the architects. But there are two more companies that come up in every silicon photonics conversation, and I think you deserve to hear about them because the full picture matters. These are the legacy players — large, established companies coming at this from a very different position.</p>

<p>The next company is Intel, ticker INTC, and this one is a little uncomfortable. Because Intel is genuinely a pioneer in silicon photonics. They've been researching this technology since 2004. They demonstrated the first fully integrated optical I/O chiplet in January 2025. They have deep IP. But Intel's patent filings in silicon photonics have dropped significantly since 2023. They're still at the R&D stage while TSMC is planning mass production. And the company as a whole is struggling. Revenue has declined from $79 billion in 2021 down to about $53 billion. Net income was negative $267 million in the most recent year, and the year before that was a loss of nearly $19 billion.</p>

<div class="broll">[B-roll: INTC stock chart + company logo]</div>

<p>The stock moved from around $18 at the lows to the mid-$50s. But the forward P/E is 91, which is hard to justify when the business is unprofitable and revenue is flat to declining. If Intel Foundry Services gains traction and they can leverage their SiPho IP as a differentiator, there's a story there. But the company has much bigger problems to solve first. Analysts have a target around $47, which actually implies downside from current levels.</p>

<div class="broll">[Screenshot: TipRanks INTC forecast]</div>

<p>And the final company on this list is Cisco, ticker CSCO. Now Cisco is one of those names that most investors already know, and they actually made a smart move back in 2021 when they acquired Acacia Communications for about $4.5 billion. Acacia makes silicon photonics-based coherent optics, and Cisco has been integrating that technology into their routers and switches. The financials are solid from a business quality standpoint. Revenue is about $57 billion. Forward P/E of 18. They generate over $13 billion in free cash flow. Gross margins are 65%. This is a profitable, stable company. But Acacia is a tiny piece of Cisco's overall business. Silicon photonics exposure relative to total revenue is minimal. And Cisco tends to move slowly. They're not the company that's going to lead the 1.6T charge — they'll adopt it, but they won't drive it. Analysts give Cisco about 15% upside with a target around $89.</p>

<div class="broll">[Screenshot: TipRanks CSCO forecast]</div>

<p>Alright, so I promised you my personal ranking — strongest to weakest — and here it is. This is how I'd stack every company we covered, based on their silicon photonics exposure, the growth trajectory, the valuation, and the risk profile.</p>

<div class="broll">[Show visual: silicon_photonics_visuals/ranking_reveal.html — hold 15-20 seconds]</div>

<p>Number one, Tower Semiconductor, TSEM. Closest thing to a pure play. NVIDIA partner. Zero debt. 75% SiPho segment growth. This is my highest-conviction name on the list. Number two, Coherent, COHR. Component leader in the middle of the 1.6T transition. Record revenue. PEG ratio of 0.34. Hard to ignore at this growth rate. Number three, Marvell, MRVL. The Celestial AI acquisition could be a leapfrog move. Forward P/E of 23 gives you the most reasonable valuation among the top names, but integration risk is real. Number four, GlobalFoundries, GFS. The dark horse. SiPho revenue doubling year over year inside a stable foundry. PEG of 0.89. Best value play on this list, you need patience with the flat base business. Number five, Broadcom, AVGO. CPO leader inside a machine of a company. If you want this theme without losing sleep, this is it. Number six, Lumentum, LITE. Great position, great growth, but the valuation is stretched. Forward P/E of 95 with negative free cash flow means you need the 1.6T ramp to be bigger than expected. Number seven, NVIDIA, NVDA. The reason this entire thesis exists. But you're buying NVIDIA for AI compute, not for SiPho specifically. Number eight, Intel, INTC. A genuine pioneer that's losing its lead. The company has much bigger problems to solve. Number nine, Cisco, CSCO. Solid business, tiny SiPho exposure. If you already own it, great. But I wouldn't buy Cisco specifically for this theme. And TSMC is the wild card that both validates the entire thesis and threatens the margins of the foundry players.</p>

<p>Here's how I think about this whole space. Everybody talks about the AI infrastructure trade — buy the companies building the infrastructure instead of trying to pick which AI model wins. And that's smart. But silicon photonics is the infrastructure underneath the infrastructure. It's the foundation that everything else gets built on top of. Every hyperscaler — AWS, Google, Meta, Microsoft — needs this technology. The physics demands it. Copper can't scale. Light can. And 2026 looks like the inflection year.</p>

<p>Well, I also want to mention STMicroelectronics. They re-entered silicon photonics in early 2025 with their PIC100 process, built in collaboration with AWS at their 300mm fab in France. The fact that AWS is investing directly in the silicon photonics supply chain tells you something about the demand side. But STM isn't really a way to play this theme as an investor — SiPho is a small piece of their business. I mention it because it's another data point confirming that the hyperscalers are all moving in this direction.</p>

<p>I happen to believe that the companies building the foundation always matter more than the ones standing on top of it. That's true in construction, it's true in technology, and right now it's true in AI.</p>

<p>I'll have links to all the research and resources I used in the description below so you can dig into these yourself. As always, thanks so much for watching.</p>
